Hi! 

Welcome to the official documentation of WordWeaver, a tool for creating your very own verb conjugator! This technology shows you how to turn your pre-existing language data into an interactive verb conjugation web application. If you don't have any language data yet, we'll also be posting information on how to create your own language model. To make your own WordWeaver, your going to have to be familiar with some basics of web development, but luckily there are lots of great courses online to learn for free, and we will try to make this documentation as clear as possible. This tool is in active development, so please make sure to check back often for updates.
